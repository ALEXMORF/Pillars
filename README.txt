My submission to the UCSD Game Dev Club's Fall Game Jam:

Game name: Pillars

The game uses real-time raytracing technology, which is achieved by performing sphere tracing with signed distance field to
3D geometries. This property is exploited to perform precise collision response and infinite geometry rendering. 

Gameplay wise, it's just a game where you walk on a lonely plane with infinite pillars. Mainly just demonstrating the 
renderer I built.
